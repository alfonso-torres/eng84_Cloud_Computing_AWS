Building out a data center can easily cost a company millions of dollars. So this allows companies to avoid costly infrastructure investments and easily access their data via the cloud.

3. Test and Development:

The flexibility of the cloud allows for environments to be built up, tested and torn down quickly. There is no need to wait months for the provisioning of a new environment.
